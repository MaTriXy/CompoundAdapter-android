Android library that provides a way to define a RecyclerView.Adapter out of subadapters (AdapterGroup).


Features
========
- AdapterGroup: Adapter containing inner addapters.
- Nesting: AdapterGroups can have other AdapterGroups
- Performance: Child adapters of the same type can recycle ViewHolders (as expected)
- Edit the adapter structure while the AdapterGroup is attached to the RecyclerView
